Downloading municipality-level data from eStats
================

This repository includes a sample R script to download municipality-level data from e-Stat: Portal Site of Official Statistics of Japan. You should first register at https://www.e-stat.go.jp/api/ to get your appId. 

This code relies on the `estatapi` and `tidyverse` packages. Please install them to use my code!
